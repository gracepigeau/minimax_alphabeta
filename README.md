# Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning
Alpha Beta optimization returns the same move as the standard minimax, but it increases efficiency by pruning (removing) all the nodes that would result in a worse decision than a previously examined move.

# Motivation
Project is/was created for CISC 352 at Queen's University for Professor Kaos in 2018.

# Use
The script requires a single alphabeta.txt file which contains a graph definition.
